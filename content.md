As an intern on the Web Services team, I contributed to the development of Little Caesars global online ordering back end which is built within the C#/.NET environment. I was originally assigned to the "Favorite Order" project along with other interns where I completed the back end's RESTful API ahead of schedule. Now a part-time developer, I have contributed to the maintenance and implementation of new features, migrated legacy code, unraveled annoying bugs, and written unit tests.
